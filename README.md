# MicrosoftSentinel-DocumentAnalytics

This is a basic python script that aims to assist SOC teams in creating 
documentation for their Microsoft Sentinel analytic rules. The script
utilizes python-docx to automate creation of a Microsoft Word document
with the relevant analytic rule details. This script also supports the
creation of markdown files, and has an option to have OpenAI's GPT 
assist in creating some of the documentation!

## Details

This script works by first obtaining a list of all analytic rules installed
in the Microsoft Sentinel workspace. From there, it will create a Microsoft 
Word document. This script will also attempt to retrieve the tables used in 
each query (**NOTE**: this will not parse out any KQL functions). The 
included document is formatted for the following details:

| | |
|----|----|
| **GUID** | Automatically generated from the analytic rule GUID |
| **Description** | Automatically generated from the analytic rule description |
| **Severity** | Automatically generated from the analytic rule severity|
| **Requirements** | Automatically generated from the Log Analytics tables used in the query|
| **Tactics** | Automatically generated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics defined for the analtic rule|

- **Triage steps:** include steps for SOC analysts to follow for triage here

- **Change notes:** track changes made to the analytic rule here

## Requirements

This script is written in Python3 and requires the following packages:

- `azure-mgmt-securityinsight`
- `azure-mgmt-loganalytics`
- `azure-identity`
- `python-docx`
- `mdutils`
- `openai`

Install with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may need to install `azure-mgmt-loganalytics==13.0.0b6`. I had a problem retrieving log analytics table names with the default version `12.0.0` similar to the issue shown here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/28161

## Configuration

### Azure authentication

This script uses the `DefaultAzureCredential` credential class for 
authenticating to Azure. See the Azure 
[documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-python#defaultazurecredential) 
page to learn how to configure your local environment.


### Document styling

To customize the look of the resulting Word document, open 
[`NewDocTemplate.docx`](./NewDocTemplate.docx) in Microsoft Word and make your 
changes. The table is configured to use the "NewStyle" table style.

The screenshot below shows the default styling:

### Open AI GPT integration
There is an included flag that uses OpenAI's Chat completion API to help generate
some of the fields, such as the runbook and false positives section. It's highly recommended
to have a human manually review the output for correctness ðŸ™‚

To enable the integration, use the `-a` flag. You will be asked to enter your OpenAI API key.

> [!NOTE]
> This will greatly increase the time to generate the documentation.
